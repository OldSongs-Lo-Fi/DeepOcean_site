        <div class="header-info">
            The depths of the ocean are some of the most remote and least understood places on the planet, so it makes sense that the creatures who call the deep sea home are fascinating, weird, and—above all—creepy. The fact that they never see the light of day means that they've evolved to look quite different than their shallow-water counterparts.

            Listed below are ten of the most strange-looking, horrifying, and spine-chilling critters that dwell in the darkest parts of the ocean. Seriously, some of them are the stuff of nightmares.

        <div class="fish-info">The sarcastic fringehead (named after my twelve-year-old self) is a deep-sea creature that lives off the west coast of North America. These fish grow to an average of a foot in length and have terrible tempers, which often result in "mouth wrestling" matches over turf. They’re creepy and also really, really weird.</div>
